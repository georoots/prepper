# GeoRoots Prepper
Browser based tool that convers spreadsheet data into EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) compatible GeoJSON format

This tool has been developed for everyone who keeps geolocations tracked in spreadsheets and need to convert them into suitable GeoJSON format.

Because it is running only locally, for large amounts of data it will consume significant amount of RAM. Approximately 2GB RAM for 5000 records.

## Usage

* Open the prepper.html file in your browser.
* Select a language from the dropdown at the top.
* Prepare your data in an MS Excel / LibreOffice Calc / OpenOffice Calc
* Copy the data in the spreadsheet into clipboard, select the top cell in the top row and paste all data.
* Correct any highlighted errors.
* Press Export GeoJSON to download the data in EUDR compatible format. This file can be then viewed in GeoRoots Mapper and submitted into EUDR DDS portal directly.

## FAQ

##### Q: **My language is not included. Can it be added?**
A: Yes, please open an issue ticket and request a new language.

##### Q: **Do I have to submit farmer names?**
A: Some buyers might request that information, but in general submitting individual farmer names in not neccessary and instead we recommend putting the organization's, company's or cooperative's name into the Producer Name column.

##### Q: **What is my country code?**
A: As far as we understand, EUDR DDS follows this format: [Wikipedia ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)

##### Q: **What fields are required?**
A: Mandatory fields are only geoinformation + size in case it is a point. But we stronly recommend including unique place identifier code into the Place Reference at the very least.

##### Q: **My geocoordinates are in DMS (degrees, minutes and seconds) format. How can I convert them into decimals?**
A: We recommend trying following formula in Excel:
   ```
=IFERROR(
  LET(
    txt, TRIM(P3),
    cleaned, SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(txt, "Â°", "|"), "'", "|"), """", "|"), CHAR(160), ""),
    m, TEXTSPLIT(cleaned, "|"),
    deg, VALUE(INDEX(m,1)),
    min, VALUE(INDEX(m,2)),
    sec, VALUE(INDEX(m,3)),
    dir, UPPER(RIGHT(txt,1)),
    validDir, ISNUMBER(MATCH(dir, {"N","S","E","W"}, 0)),
    validValues, AND(deg>=0, min>=0, sec>=0),
    dec, deg + min/60 + sec/3600,
    IF(AND(validDir, validValues),
       IF(OR(dir="S", dir="W"), -dec, dec),
       "Invalid Data"
    )
  ),
  "Invalid Data"
)
```
